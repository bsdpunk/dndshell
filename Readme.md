# An all purpose DND Shell

A shell for all things DND.

## Installation

If you have go installed, it's easy:

```
go get github.com/bsdpunk/dndshell
```

## Monsters
Listing all Monsters currently works. Selecting a monster by ID works, but returns a go structure currently. Getting a limited, better formated Statblock works.


```
